# Data-Science-Applications-for-Entrepreneurs-Course-Summary

## Overview

This repository contains all assignments and the final project completed for the course "Data Science Applications for Entrepreneurs". The course focused on applying data science techniques to solve practical business problems. Below is a detailed summary of each assignment and the final project.

## Assignments
### Assignment 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### Objective: 
Perform exploratory data analysis on the abb_nyc_data.csv dataset.
#### Review:
This assignment involved setting up a Jupyter Notebook and importing essential libraries. The task was to analyze the dataset by answering specific questions about its structure and contents, such as the number of rows   and columns, neighborhood information, room types, and pricing details. Additionally, visualizations such as box plots, histograms, and bar charts were created to present the data more effectively.

### Assignment 2: K-Means Clustering
#### Objective: 
Perform K-Means clustering on the air_traffic.csv dataset.
#### Review:
The assignment required building a K-Means clustering model to group similar data points based on specified features. The optimal number of clusters was determined using silhouette scores. The results were visualized, and business applications for the identified clusters were suggested, providing insights into potential marketing campaigns and competitive analysis.

### Assignment 3: Classification with Decision Trees
#### Objective: 
Build and evaluate a decision tree model using the bank_marketing.csv dataset.
#### Review:
This assignment focused on building a decision tree classifier to predict customer responses to a bank's marketing campaign. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and the model's accuracy was evaluated. The decision tree was visualized to understand the decision-making process. The assignment also involved calculating the Gini index and interpreting the model's results for practical applications.

### Assignment 4: Linear Programming
#### Objective: 
Solve an optimization problem for maximizing sales revenue of salads and pizzas.
#### Review:
The assignment involved defining the objective function, decision variables, and constraints for a linear programming problem. The goal was to maximize sales revenue by determining the optimal number of salads and pizzas to prepare given certain resource constraints. The problem was solved graphically, and the optimum solution was documented in a provided PDF.

### Final Project: Achieving Long-Term Success Through Enhanced Candidate Selection
#### Objective: 
Apply data science techniques to improve the candidate selection process for "Inerview" company, focusing on identifying candidates who are likely to stay long-term.
#### Detailed Review:
##### Background
The final project integrates various data science techniques to address a real-world business problem. It involves data analysis, clustering, classification, and optimization, building on the skills developed in the previous assignments.
##### Project Components
**Data Collection and Preparation:**
  - Collected relevant datasets from various sources.
  - Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's structure and key features.
  - Converted the data into a binary format to simplify analysis.
  - Created a scoring metric tailored for evaluating candidates based on key traits.
**Clustering Analysis:**
  - Applied K-Means clustering to identify distinct groups within the top 25 candidates.
  - Evaluated different numbers of clusters using silhouette scores.
  - Identified "strong" clusters characterized by long-term retention potential.
**Evaluation:**
  - Employed the silhouette score to assess the quality of clustering results.
  - Visualized the clusters using bar charts to highlight key traits of each cluster.
**Results and Insights:**
  - Identified clusters of candidates with high potential for long-term retention.
  - Provided recommendations for optimizing the candidate selection process.
##### Key Findings and Insights
**Data Analysis:** Identified key traits correlated with long-term success in the sales position.
**Clustering:** Revealed distinct candidate segments with high retention potential.
**Evaluation:** Demonstrated the effectiveness of clustering in improving candidate selection.
##### Conclusion
The final project demonstrates the practical application of data science techniques in enhancing candidate selection processes. By combining exploratory data analysis, clustering, and evaluation, the project provides valuable insights and solutions for improving long-term employee retention.
