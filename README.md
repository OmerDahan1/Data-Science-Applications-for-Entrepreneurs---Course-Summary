# Data-Science-Applications-for-Entrepreneurs-Course-Summary

## Overview

This repository contains all assignments and the final project completed for the course "Data Science Applications for Entrepreneurs". The course focused on applying data science techniques to solve practical business problems. Below is a detailed summary of each assignment and the final project.

## Assignments
### Assignment 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### Objective: 
Perform exploratory data analysis on the abb_nyc_data.csv dataset.
#### Review:
This assignment involved setting up a Jupyter Notebook and importing essential libraries. The task was to analyze the dataset by answering specific questions about its structure and contents, such as the number of rows   and columns, neighborhood information, room types, and pricing details. Additionally, visualizations such as box plots, histograms, and bar charts were created to present the data more effectively.

### Assignment 2: K-Means Clustering
#### Objective: 
Perform K-Means clustering on the air_traffic.csv dataset.
#### Review:
The assignment required building a K-Means clustering model to group similar data points based on specified features. The optimal number of clusters was determined using silhouette scores. The results were visualized, and business applications for the identified clusters were suggested, providing insights into potential marketing campaigns and competitive analysis.

### Assignment 3: Classification with Decision Trees
#### Objective: 
Build and evaluate a decision tree model using the bank_marketing.csv dataset.
#### Review:
This assignment focused on building a decision tree classifier to predict customer responses to a bank's marketing campaign. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and the model's accuracy was evaluated. The decision tree was visualized to understand the decision-making process. The assignment also involved calculating the Gini index and interpreting the model's results for practical applications.

### Assignment 4: Linear Programming
#### Objective: 
Solve an optimization problem for maximizing sales revenue of salads and pizzas.
#### Review:
The assignment involved defining the objective function, decision variables, and constraints for a linear programming problem. The goal was to maximize sales revenue by determining the optimal number of salads and pizzas to prepare given certain resource constraints. The problem was solved graphically, and the optimum solution was documented in a provided PDF.
